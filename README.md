This project analyzes the stock performance of JPMorgan during two major economic crises: the 2008 Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 Pandemic. Using multivariate statistical techniques, the analysis explores patterns, trends, and key differences in stock behavior across these periods.

The datasets used are:

data1.csv: Captures stock data during the 2008 Financial Crisis.
data2.csv: Reflects stock data during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
The project includes detailed exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction using PCA, outlier detection through multivariate normal distributions, and clustering with PERMANOVA to identify structural differences in market behavior.

A comprehensive report is provided, outlining all methods, results, and interpretations in depth.
